# incremental-game

This is a game where you mine some ore. Then you do stuff with it.

# future updates

in the near -- or far -- future, these are things that will most likely be implemented.

  - smelt ore into gold ingots manually
  - use furnaces to smelt ore into gold
  - upgrades
    - gameData.furnaceSmeltSpeed // speed of furnace, in ms, it takes to smelt gameData.furnaceEfficiency ore into ingots.
    - gameData.furnaceEfficiency // original value = 50, this would decrease ore input requirements.
    - gameData.upgradeCostMultiplier // multiplies all upgrades and costs by number (example, 0.995x original cost).
  ...
  - leveling or prestige system
  - expansion ???
  - beautification of ui
